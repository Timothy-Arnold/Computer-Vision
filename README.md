# Computer-vision

## Milestone 1

Using the Teachable Machine website I have created a computer vision model with 4 classes: Rock, Paper, Scissors and Nothing, using hundreds of training images for each class. I will be using this model to make a game which allows users to play Rock Paper Scissors against the Computer using their own webcam.
